# Kreator Engine

### Kreator Engine Provides A Framework to WebGL Development

I have developed this project for my computer graphics class. Later, couldn't complete. At the time of devbelopment, I was not good at package managers, project configuration etc. thus I implemented it in pure JavaScript ES6 by hand LOL.

[Here is the personal meltdown with pure JS.](KreatorEngine/public_html/js/KreatorEngine.js)

This project is closed but maybe rewritten in typescript.
